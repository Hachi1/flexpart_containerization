This `README.md` file contains some quick notes on the documentation in this
folder. See the `README.md` file in the repository root for the main
repository documentation.

The `documentation` folder contains the final version of the bachelors thesis
that was the original motivation for this project as a pdf. This bachelor
thesis serves as a very detailed background documentation for this project. It
refers to this repository up to the `alpendac_prototype` tag in the history
and will not be updated to reflect any later changes.
